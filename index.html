        Due to the progress of the country at the end of 
        the XIX century, Uruguay had a period in its 
        history when it was referred to as the Switzerland 
        of America . Additionally, many families came on 
        ships from European countries in search of new 
        opportunities and a better life, but it cannot be 
        forgotten that this was a land that was populated 
        by natives like the rest of America.

    There were various indigenous ethnicities in 
Uruguay: Guenoas, Yaros, Minuanes, Guaraníes 
and Charrúas. This last group moved from our 
coasts towards the north as the colonizers 
advanced in their conquest. The Charrúas were 
the ones who also had the unfortunate 
encounter with Juan Díaz de Solís in 1516.

Although the Charrúas were smaller in quantity, 
they were distributed throughout Uruguay, Entre 
Ríos and southern Brazil. They were popular for 
being distant from the rest of society, more 
independent and wild, meaning they were more 
skillful and brave in battle. They were also nomads, 
they hunted to eat and lived in "tolderías".

The Charrúas lived in a continuous struggle
against the colonizers for approximately 260 
years, and, after many battles, their people 
decreased in number and finally suffered their 
greatest loss in “Salsipuedes” in 1831. The 
Charrúas were deceived, cornered and murdered, 
leaving several women and children alone. They 
were later divided among different Uruguayan 
families.
Usually, when there is a football match that 
becomes difficult, or Uruguay is going through an 
adverse situation, Uruguayans remember their 
"Garra Charrúa", due to that strength that would 
be an inheritance of our indigenous ancestors. But 
it is not a simple legend.

Currently, many anthropologists and researchers 
are trying to recover the history of our indigenous 
people. There are many descendants forming 
groups, trying to reconstruct their own identity 
and wishing to be heard with their documents and 
stories. They want to be recognized as 
Uruguayans but also as indigenous of a new 
century.
